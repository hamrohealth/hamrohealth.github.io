                            <p>This self-assessment has questions that will help figure out whether you are showing any warning signs of anxiety. Please read each question carefully, and answer how often you have experienced the same or similar challenges in the past few weeks. This test will not give you a diagnosis, but it will give you a better idea of how you are feeling and what the next steps could be.</p>
